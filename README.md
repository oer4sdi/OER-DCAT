# OER-DCAT (Data Catalog Vocabulary)
This repository contains the tutorial "DCAT (Data Catalog Vocabulary)" which is available for reuse as an Open Educational Resorce (OER). DCAT is a W3C recommendation for describing datasets on the web. DCAT can be used to describe datasets and data services in a catalog using standard terms that facilitate the consumption and aggregation of metadata from multiple catalogs.

In this tutorial, you will learn: 

- how important a standardized metadata format is for sharing geospatial data
- how to create DCAT metadata using RDForms
- how to use Docker to download and configure Apache Jena Fuseki Server
- how to use SPARQL to query DCAT metadata

##### This tutorial is structured as follows:

- Overview
- Background
	- Data Sharing and Metadata
	- Resource Description Framework (RDF)
	- Data Catalog Vocabulary (DCAT)
	- DCAT Profiles
- Practical Exercises
	- Practical Example of DCAT
	- Creating, Editing and Visualizing DCAT metadata with RDForms DCAT Editor
	- Running SPARQL Queries on DCAT metadata.
- Summary and Discussion

### Target Audience and Prerequisites
This tutorial is designed for students and professionals who want to improve their understanding of Spatial Information Infrastructures, and in particular, how DCAT promotes the reusability and interoperability of spatial data. We assume that you have basic knowledge about the concept of linked data, spatial data and spatial data services (for example Web Map Services (WMS) and Web Feature Services (WFS)). If you dont, you can still proceed with the module as we will not be going into the technical details or usage of the spatial data and data services, but just how they are described using DCAT.

In both cases, you will need about 90 minutes to use this tutorial. It would also be great if you also had some experience with Docker. However, the tutorial will guide you through the various steps of working with Docker and can be used to gain initial hands-on experience with it.

### How to use the OER module

Simply download the PDF file from the /docs folder, read and follow the tutorial.
